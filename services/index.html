				<p style="font-size: 20px; text-decoration: underline;">submission guidelines:</p>
				<p style="margin-bottom: 1ch;">in the subject line of your email, consider including the type of service being requested (e.g. "composition", "mixing & mastering", etc.)</p>
				<p style="font-weight: bold; margin-bottom: 0.5ch;">for mixing and/or mastering services:</p>
				<p style="margin-bottom: 0.5ch;">- please send all files in the sample rate/bit depth they were recorded and/or rendered in. (e.g. if your track was recorded in 24-bit WAV at 96kHz, then send it at that resolution.) it doesn't matter if the rates are inconsistent between tracks. all common header formats and resolutions up to 192KHz (32-bit float) are supported.</p>
				<p style="margin-bottom: 0.5ch;">- please ensure that there is no unintended clipping (intersample or otherwise). if you aren't sure how to check for clipping on rendered tracks, shoot me an email and I can provide instructions per your specific situation. (I usually defer to <a href="https://lufs.org" target="_blank">lufs.org</a>.)</p>
				<p style="margin-bottom: 0.5ch;">- when rendering stems/premasters, try to preserve any bus/group effects in your renders (note: bus processing will not necessarily sound the same on solo'd stems as it does on the entire bus). also, if you already have rough mixes that you like aspects of, feel free to send those in a separate subfolder for reference.</p>
				<p style="margin-bottom: 0.5ch;">- pay close attention to the track lengths to ensure they're correct before submitting. in most cases I will assume that what I receive is what you intended, so make sure that your renders weren't offset/trimmed off in some majorly unintended way.</p>
				<p style="margin-bottom: 0.5ch;">- try to keep the filenames relatively consistent. consider having each filename start with track numbers (e.g. 01_trackname1.wav, 02_trackname2.wav, etc.) if you require anything niche or specific in regards to track ordering, specify as such in your email.</p>

			<div class="entry" style="max-width: 900px;">
				<p style="font-size: 20px; text-decoration: underline;">answers to frequently asked questions:</p>
				<p>- I typically charge around $100 for each of the services I offer (excluding original compositions, which vary a lot in price and are usually more expensive). price adjustments are made depending on the length and scope of the work in question. all prices are negotiable.</p>
				<p>- mixing/mastering services have a 2 week turnaround time on average, sometimes less depending on my overall workload and the length of the record in question. other requests will have varying turnaround time depending on complexity.</p>
				<p>- as for payment plans, I can't offer a definitive answer for every case, but I'm willing to work those details out on an individual basis.</p>
